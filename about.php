							<h2> 2016 </h2>
							<p>Jamie my Love was born - radiating love, playfulness and a vibrant soul.</p>

							<p>Our brand set out to seize the day, empower young women in business and make a positive impact on all of those involved with Jamie my Love. We bring creativity and passion to all our endeavours.</p>
							<h2> 2017 </h2>
							<p>Founder Megan and Jamie travelled abroad, looking for the best textiles and ethical factories to bring Megan’s trendy designs to life in Australia.  All factories were vetted in person, to ensure good working conditions and ethical supply chains are maintained - we want our customers to feel as great about wearing our clothes as we do creating them.</p>

							<p>Jamie my Love landed in Queensland and soon hit boutiques across Australia. 
							</p>

							<h2> 2018 </h2>
							<p>
							Growing quickly, Jamie my Love went global.  We entered the UK, New Zealand, Noumea, Dubai, Europe, Singapore and the USA.</p>

							<p>Megan and Jamie again ventured forth to extend overseas operations and ensure our customers always get the best of everything.</p>  

							<p>Envisioning a business filled with like-minded individuals and positive energy, Megan began recruiting the best young women around – Lee (operations), Sammi (design), Margie (media and marketing) and Mabel (logistics) joined the team. </p> 

							<p>With our fabulous new designer, a keen eye for style and courage, Jamie brought our customers something new and out-of-the-box.</p>  

							<p>Asking “what makes a great piece of clothing?” Jamie focused on quality, style and fit above all else.  Pattern making and sampling were moved to Australia to support local jobs – and our fits became perfect!
							</p>
							<h2> 2019 </h2>
							<p>
							<p>Jamie my Love will be landing in major department stores in USA, Canada, Japan, UAE and UK. </p>

							<p>Watch this space for news of our global domination.</p>
							</p>
							<h2> giving back </h2>
							<p>

							<p>Jamie my love strives to give back to the Australian community by supporting selected charities each year. </p>

							<p>This year the team will again focus on the environment, supporting the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program.
